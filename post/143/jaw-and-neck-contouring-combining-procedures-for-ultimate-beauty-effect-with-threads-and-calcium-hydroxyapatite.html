Various modifications of the technique have been introduced to simplify the procedure for both patient and the practitioner. Early signs of aging in facial skin results from elastic tissue and collagen degradation, causing fine-to-deep wrinkles. In addition to decreased laxity, generalized thinning of subcutaneous fat tissue leads to volume depletion and a sagging appearance, especially on the jowls and neck. Always correct lax skin in the neck, one to two weeks using Calcium Hydroxylapatite (CaHA) to increase the body’s natural ability to produce collagen and elastin before a lifting procedure using threads with Poly L-Lactide-Caprolactone P(LA/ CL) to provide a complex solution for neck and offers good results. Using non-invasive light lift threads, which was created on the basis of the bio-absorbable materials and its structure with microscopic barbs, it is reliably fixed in soft tissues and forms a strong supporting skeleton. It is possible to reach a visible lifting effect on various areas of the face as well as on the neck. Threads could be combined with calcium hydroxylapatite to stimulate of collagen and elastin to improve quality of skin two weeks prior to threads insertion. This technique is effective to create contour and reposition of the volume of different areas of the face and neckResearch Article in International Journal of Clinical &amp; Experimental</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>Aging is an inevitable process and societal ideals of youthful appearance and beauty have become the driving force on the growing interest on understanding the underlying mechanisms related to aging as well as the advancement of the facial rejuvenation procedures.</p><p><br></p><p>Aging of the lower face and neck is multifactorial and ages more remarkably. Gradual increasing of skin laxity, weakening of malar and perioral fat deposit and resorption of the alveolar bone results to loss of definition of the jawline while loss of lateral and inferior volume and ptosis of the lateral chin can create a relative protrusion of the central chin and chin widening. Development of facial jowls, on the other hand, was due to the loss of masseteric ligament support which then allows formation of facial fat to the mandibular border. Moreover, fibrous band on the neck and horizontal rhytides was the result of contraction of the platysma muscle and laxity in the overlying skin. With progressive aging, continuous descending of the hyoid bone leads to loss of definition of the cervico mental angle.</p><p><br></p><p>Features of aesthetically youthful lower face and neck includes distinct jawline, absence of jowl, proper chin projection as well as smooth transition from the cheek to chin, a well- defined cervico mental angle and absence of horizontal and vertical rhytides. Additionally, distinct sternocleidomastoid muscle, sub hyoid depression and thyroid bulge is also appreciated.</p><p><br></p><p>Compared to the upper and middle zone of the face, these areas are often neglected and undertreated when it comes to rejuvenation and contouring that leads to most disturbing appearance and became the present challenge to most aesthetic practitioner.</p><p><br></p><p>Combined minimally invasive aesthetic techniques as an alternative of surgical interventions have widespread application in clinical practice for the correction of the aging lower face and neck. This involves Thread lifting for the improvement and repositioning of the saggy areas and dermal fillers for adding volume to the depressed areas in supplementation to threads.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Materials and Methods</strong></p><p>Calcium Hydroxyapatite (CaHA) based dermal filler was administered in the saggy areas of the lower face and neck. CaHA is a biodegradable and naturally reabsorbed by the host’s metabolic processes and provides both replacement and collagen bio-stimulation as primary mechanism of action.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, bio-absorbable thread made from Polylactic Acid in combination of Polycaprolactone + Hyaluronic Acid USP 2/0 with multi directional barbs of 170 mm through the use of rounded tip cannula with the hole aside 19 gauge x 150 mm were used for threading the jowls, mandibular lifting and neck according to the degree of skin sagging and texture. P (LA/CL) + HA threads work by improving elastin and texture of the skin together with the collagen synthesis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Patient Evaluation</strong></p><p>The study was conducted at Everlast Wellness Medical Center, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Six patients with age ranging from 37-55 years old, having a concern on the lower face and neck appearance due to aging, were treated consecutively using the combination treatment of Threads and Fillers.</p><p><br></p><p>Participants included in this study should be 35-55 years oldpresenting age related concerns of the lower face and neck with no allergic history and underlying disease.

This indicates that filler and threads have improved the appearance and contour of the neck.</p><p><br></p><p>Redness, swelling and bruising immediately after the treatment were experienced by most of the subjects. This is due to the slight injury occurred during the implantation of threads and the administration of fillers that usually resolves after 3- 5 days with the proper post treatment care.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Discussion</strong></p><p>Majority of the people were anxious about the excess fullness under chin and jawline and on the appearance of horizontal and vertical line of the neck and the only intervention to address these concerns was primarily surgical however, the growing minimally invasive procedures that is used as an alternative to surgical procedures to improve the result of the lower face and neck became the demand of most of the patients who pursue a treatment with minimal risk of complication and less recovery time. The implantation of threads with the use of absorbable threads showed excellent result on the lower face and neck due to the immediate lifting of the tissue because of the mechanical action produced by the thread. Administrations of filler with the use of Calcium Hydroxylapatite to enhance the volume of the depressed areas as it stimulates neocollagenesis and improve skin quality.</p><p><br></p><p>In this study, the effect of the combination treatment of absorbable threads and CaHA filler was performed to evaluate the efficacy for the lower face and neck rejuvenation. A form of assessment was performed using the comparison of the pre-operative and post- operative treatment photos, blinded evaluation of physicians were assess on the immediately after and after 6 months post procedure and patient satisfaction score after 6 months.</p><p><br></p><p>Patient Satisfaction Scale are also relevant because of the patients perception of the treatment result is subjective. Overall, high level of satisfaction was obtained after 6 months period. Most of the patients noticed an immediate improvement of the jowls, depressed areas, skin laxity, necklines and chin projection right after the treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The level of satisfaction of patients progressed with time. The exceptional level of extreme satisfaction increased from 0% (0 case) in the immediately after to 66.7% (4 cases) in the sixth month after treatment. 33% of patients were scored as very satisfied on the same timeline.</p><p><br></p><p>Results from the photos were also transparent as it demonstrates the visible improvement of the lower face and the neck of the patients in comparison of the pre-operative photos Furthermore, no potential complications were recorded and treatment was well tolerated. Patients who undergone the treatment were able to perform their daily normal routine due to rapid recovery.</p><p><br></p><p>The result of this study for the lower face and neck rejuvenation using the combination of threads and CaHA filler showed a significant outcome and has been a very good alternative for the surgical intervention based from the assessment gathered. The condition after treatment program demonstrate a well contoured neck and jawline with better skin tone and texture due to the collagen stimulation. Individually, thread lifting and filler injection have both demonstrated the efficacy on giving definition on the saggy and depressed areas and the duration of its efficacy were last for a year or more.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Ideal perception of beauty and youthful appearance has become the reason of the growing trend on facial rejuvenation procedures. However, familiarity on the aging process and anatomy of the face is a paramount to achieve optimal natural and aesthetic result including a thorough evaluation and counseling before proceeding to any intervention.Three dimensional procedures involving relaxation, volume restoration and resuspension for the process of rejuvenation in addressing to the aging lower face and neck, which has been always neglected, works best with in-depth knowledge of properties and techniques specific to each product in the on the treatment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen Mulholland R (2014) Nonexcisional, Minimally Invasive Rejuvenation of the Neck 41: 11-31.</p><p><br></p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savoia A, Accardo C, Vannini F, Di Pasquale B, Baldi A (2014) Outcomes in thread lift for facial rejuvenation: a study performed with happy lift™ revitalizing 4: 103-114.</p><p><br></p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gabriela Outcomes in Thread Lift for Facial Rejuvenation&nbsp;&nbsp;a Study Performed with Happy Lift Revitalizing MFU in combination with CaHA for improving skin laxity in body and face.</p><p><br></p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chao YYY, Kim JW, Kim JS, Ko H, Goldie K (2018) Hyperdilution of CaHA fillers for the improvement of age and hereditary volume deficits in East Asian patients 2018: 357-363.</p><p><br></p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fabi S, Pavicic T, Braz A, Green JB, Seo K, et al.
