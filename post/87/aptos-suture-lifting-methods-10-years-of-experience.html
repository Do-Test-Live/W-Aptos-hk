The farther the portion is away from the point of force application, the less it extends.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">	Understanding the cause of this factor, we decided to develop a method of tissue extension in which the flap extends evenly along the whole length. Knowledge of the topographic anatomy and clinical experience persuaded us that on separate portions of the face the layers of soft tissues could be easily moved with no mobilization thereof, with the skin capable of shrinking under certain conditions.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">	Barbed threads have long been used in medicine to suture tendons and close wound edges; however, operations on lifting facial tissues by means of such threads to rejuvenate were first proposed by us as long ago as 1998 (<a style="color: rgb(87, 29, 31);" href="about:blank" target="_blank"><u>Fig. 2</u></a>). The name Aptos (anti- ptosis), as we called these threads, was then given to all products and technologies of minimally invasive lifting, which were developed and implemented in practice.<a style="color: rgb(87, 29, 31);" href="about:blank" target="_blank"><sup><u>5,6</u></sup></a></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p><br></p><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify">Aptos Thread, Aptos Thread 2G, Aptos Needle, Aptos Needle 2G, Aptos Spring: manufactured by the CHIRAMAX Ltd.

After the lower thread and needle emerged to the surface of the skin, the remainder of each lower thread was cut off, and, after moderate pulling, the upper&nbsp;thread&nbsp;was sutured to the fascia of the temporal muscle. The same technique was used to pull the soft tissues of the submaxillary and cervical regions with fixation of the upper end of the thread to the periosteum of the mastoid process (<a style="color: windowtext;" href="about:blank" target="_blank"><u>Fig. 3</u></a>).</p><p class="ql-align-justify">	Later in 1998, we improved this technique slightly by devising a needleless thread with converging barbs, which was introduced under the skin by means of a guiding needle, which made it possible to abandon incisions (<a style="color: windowtext;" href="about:blank" target="_blank"><u>Fig. 4</u></a>). Such a thread introduced subcutaneously is fixed in soft tissues because of the barbs converging toward the middle thereof, carrying subcutaneous fat, pulling it together and distributing it evenly along the whole length, thus creating the effect of lifting or obtaining a high contour of soft tissues.</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><img width="745" src="../../../aptos.global_443/media/1849/conversions/optimized.html"></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><img width="724" src="../../../aptos.global_443/media/1850/conversions/optimized.html"></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify">	Initially, we used this technique on virtually all portions of the face and neck.

Accordingly, we developed an optimal marking of the skin, taking into consideration anatomic and functional peculiarities of the portion concerned and the pathogenesis of the deformity involved (<a style="color: windowtext;" href="about:blank" target="_blank"><u>Fig. 5</u></a>).</p><p class="ql-align-justify">	We managed to obtain better outcomes in 35- to 50-year-old patients who had clear, not very thick skin, with no pronounced atrophy of subcutaneous fat and moderate manifestations of soft tissue ptosis (no sharply pronounced nasolabial folds, overhanging of soft tissue bolsters above them, mild distortions of the suborbital contours in the form of lachrymal grooves, and the presence of hanging lips), who for various reasons refused classic face lift operations. Mainly, these were the patients who wished mild lifting barely visible to other people. These were also patients who had previously undergone cutaneous rhytidoplasty and were not satisfied with the outcome obtained because the facial lifting had been poorly pronounced in the midface portions and high volume of the buccozygomatic regions was not attained.</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><img width="650" src="../../../aptos.global_443/media/1851/conversions/optimized.html"></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><img src="../../../aptos.global_443/media/1852/conversions/optimized.html"></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><h2 class="ql-align-justify"><br></h2><h2 class="ql-align-justify">Surgical Procedure</h2><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify">To lift the mental regions, the threads were implanted parallel to the mandibular edge with slight archlike sagging within the area of the hanging lip. Doing so, we simultaneously solved the problem of lifting and redistribution of the skin and subcutaneous fat of the hanging lips. The depth of the thread’s implantation varied depending on the thickness of the skin, fat, and the degree of involutional alterations, but obligatorily within fatty tissue, which is thicker closer to the skin.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">	The main task we accomplished while lifting the midface area was to create a new high contour of the buccozygomatic region by elevation of the ptosed soft tissues situated between the nasolabial fold and lachrymal groove. Movement of the cheek&nbsp;upward&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;slightly&nbsp;&nbsp;laterally&nbsp;&nbsp;obtained a more smoothed-out nasolabial fold and lachrymal groove.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">	This effect was achieved by placing the threads within subcutaneous fat in the form of comparatively steep arches followed by straightening&nbsp;them by pulling the ends and accordingly even closing together of soft tissues along the length&nbsp;of the threads toward the middle thereof. The effect was even more enhanced because within the middle part the threads passed relatively deep, catching SMAS and together with it elevated fatty tissues from the depth toward the surface.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">	While gaining experience, we planned ways of further developing thread-mediated lifting, with the goals of simplifying the operational technique, enhancing the power of lifting, achieving long- standing results that would persist over time, and decreasing the risk for complications and undesirable effects.</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><img width="324" src="../../../aptos.global_443/media/1853/conversions/optimized.html"></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><h2 class="ql-align-justify">Aptos Thread 2G Method</h2><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify">In 2002, we again returned to the idea of using&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a single product (ie, a needle with a thread); however, the new suture material was distin- guished by the presence of two needles to the ends of which were attached one thread provided with&nbsp;converging&nbsp;barbs—Aptos&nbsp;Thread&nbsp;&nbsp;2G&nbsp;(<a style="color: windowtext;" href="about:blank" target="_blank"><u>Fig. 6</u></a>A).

Implementation of the idea of the coupled needles and a novel technique of the operation made it possible to place the threads with no cutaneous incisions through a puncture, obtaining no skin in-drawings in the place of the thread’s bend: both needles were stuck into the skin with the common tip, to be detached under the skin at the required depth and only thereafter advanced in the opposite directions.

For correction of involutive alterations in the perioral area we therefore used the Aptos Spring method.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">	In virtually all cases, this technique allowed removal of labiosubmaxillary wrinkles and provided nonrigid, elastic lifting of the angles of the mouth in the immediate and remote postoperative periods. Polypropylene springs placed in subcutaneous fat in the distended form contract and delicately entail the soft tissues. They contract and extend synchronously with the muscles during the mimic and masticatory movements. Several months after, the threads are covered with fibrous tissue, which later enhances and stabilizes the effect. With the exception of several cases of a rapid relapse of the deformity, when the contracting springs were not fixed in tissues but slipped into the needle-created channel, we observed&nbsp;a&nbsp;stable&nbsp;outcome&nbsp;within 1 to 2 years (<a style="color: windowtext;" href="about:blank" target="_blank"><u>Figs. 35–38</u></a>).</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><img width="570" src="../../../aptos.global_443/media/1871/conversions/optimized.html"></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><img width="564" src="../../../aptos.global_443/media/1872/conversions/optimized.html"></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><img width="541" src="../../../aptos.global_443/media/1873/conversions/optimized.html"></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><img width="543" src="../../../aptos.global_443/media/1874/conversions/optimized.html"></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><img width="528" src="../../../aptos.global_443/media/1875/conversions/optimized.html"></p><h2 class="ql-align-justify">Complications and Undesirable Events</h2><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify">While performing any aesthetic operation or minimally invasive manipulation on the face one can encounter complications, such as inflammatory processes up to suppuration; disturbed integrity&nbsp;of the parotid salivary gland, little branches of the facial nerve or large vessels; and hematomas. The Aptos methods are not guaranteed against such complications.<a style="color: windowtext;" href="about:blank" target="_blank"><sup><u>10–12 </u></sup></a>Such complications are not intrinsic to the nature of the method itself. Prevention of the mentioned complications consists of observing the principles of the regional anatomy of the face and its peculiarities, using asepsis and antiseptics, delicately performing an intervention, and treatment, including antibacterial therapy, general surgical intervention, and special intervention (microsurgical, physiotherapeutic, and others) (<a style="color: windowtext;" href="about:blank" target="_blank"><u>Figs. 39, 40</u></a>).</p><p>	Characteristic of the methods of threadmediated lifting and side effects are as follows: For the Aptos Thread method: disruption of the threads as a consequence of unilateral slackening of the barbs, surfacing of the threads, their migration, a short in&nbsp;time (up to 3 months) and unstable result.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">For all Aptos methods: asymmetry, hypercorrection, visualization of the threads, linear hemorrhages along the length of the thread, hematomas, and dimpling of the skin in the site of needle punctures (<a style="color: windowtext;" href="about:blank" target="_blank"><u>Figs. 41–46</u></a>).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>   Prevention of the mentioned complications, side effects, and undesirable events consists of knowing the pathogenesis of ageing and ptosis&nbsp;of the facial soft tissues, correct understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;of the essence of lifting by the Aptos&nbsp;methods and selecting the proper method, faultless handling of the technique, and delicate performance of the intervention. Treatment is associated with removal of the slackened and migrating threads, repeat thread-mediated or classic lifting, physiotherapy, and massage.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">	For thread removal in our clinic we use the methods of noninvasive detection of threads under the skin (ultrasonography, visualization by means of bright directed light) and minimally invasive removal thereof by means of a special needle.</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><img width="590" src="../../../aptos.global_443/media/1876/conversions/optimized.html"></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><img width="571" src="../../../aptos.global_443/media/1877/conversions/optimized.html"></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p>With experience, this manipulation presents no difficulty for the operator (<a style="color: windowtext;" href="about:blank" target="_blank"><u>Fig. 47</u></a>).</p><p class="ql-align-justify">	Complications and unfavorable events are so rare and inconsiderable that specialists in aesthetic surgery and cosmetology should not abandon the methods of thread-mediated lifting for this reason.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">	As we have gained experience in using the Aptos methods, we have been constantly improving them, enhancing the power of lifting, the safety of the operation, and the durability and stability of the results.</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><img width="594" src="../../../aptos.global_443/media/1878/conversions/optimized.html"></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><img width="543" src="../../../aptos.global_443/media/1879/conversions/optimized.html"></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><img src="../../../aptos.global_443/media/1880/conversions/optimized.html"></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><img src="../../../aptos.global_443/media/1881/conversions/optimized.html">     <img width="302" src="../../../aptos.global_443/media/1882/conversions/optimized.html"></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify">	We have experienced all things characteristic of implementing any novel technologies: initial admiration and euphoria, disappointments, complications, and cautious attitude. Because of these circumstances and because doctors of our clinic are the designers of the Aptos methods we can express our opinion concerning thread-mediated lifting methods suggested by other authors.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">	Many doctors have still been placing barbed threads using an outdated technique that requires incisions and visualization of solid structures (for example, temporal fascia) to which threads are sewn. With the advent of coupled needles provided with threads and the respective tech- nology (methods using Aptos Thread 2G and Aptos Needle 2G), there is no need for skin incisions, and the operations are thus considerably simplified with no damage for the future result (<a style="color: windowtext;" href="about:blank" target="_blank"><u>Fig. 48</u></a>).<a style="color: windowtext;" href="about:blank" target="_blank"><sup><u>13</u></sup></a></p><p class="ql-align-justify">	We doubt the efficacy of using long barbed threads for lifting and rigid fixation of the kinetically active zones of the face and neck, and the feasibility of their use without taking into consideration the anatomic peculiarities of various facial regions (<a style="color: windowtext;" href="about:blank" target="_blank"><u>Fig. 48</u></a>B). The authors of this methodology do not explain, for instance, what happens to the threads’ barbs directed from the temporal or even bregmatic areas through the entire cheek downward to the submaxillary region, when a person widely opens his or her mouth. Also unclear is what happens to threads that have been advanced from the temporal area downward to&nbsp;the upper&nbsp;lip (the nasolabial triangle), to the labiomental&nbsp;fold (marionette line) when the patient produces mimic movements of the lips and the entire perioral area. Procedures placing threads from the retroaural area to the submental and cervical regions in the form of a fan also usually prove to be ineffective (<a style="color: windowtext;" href="about:blank" target="_blank"><u>Fig. 48</u></a>B).<a style="color: windowtext;" href="about:blank" target="_blank"><sup><u>14</u></sup></a></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><img src="../../../aptos.global_443/media/1883/conversions/optimized.html"></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><img width="705" src="../../../aptos.global_443/media/1884/conversions/optimized.html"></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><img src="../../../aptos.global_443/media/1885/conversions/optimized.html"></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><img src="../../../aptos.global_443/media/1886/conversions/optimized.html"></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify">We also do not recommend following the advice of those colleagues who lift the whole eyebrow and even the forehead by threadmediated methods.<a style="color: windowtext;" href="about:blank" target="_blank"><sup><u>15 </u></sup></a>Doing so, they do not take into consideration the presence of the&nbsp;powerful frontal muscle and its kinetics, which rapidly destroy&nbsp;the&nbsp;barbs&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;threads,&nbsp;leading&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;a relapse of the deformity (<a style="color: windowtext;" href="about:blank" target="_blank"><u>Fig. 48</u></a>C).

Intraoperative findings showed that the implanted threads were in those sites where they had been placed. Neither their color nor their structure was altered, and their removal required considerable effort because of powerful coherence of the barbs with the tissues. Histology revealed that within tissues, the Aptos Threads were covered with a solid fibrous membrane, which was especially pronounced around the barbs, which is yet another explanation of the cause of stability and persistence of good clinical results (<a style="color: windowtext;" href="about:blank" target="_blank"><u>Fig. 49</u></a>).<a style="color: windowtext;" href="about:blank" target="_blank"><sup><u>21,22</u></sup></a></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><h1>SUMMARY</h1><p class="ql-align-justify">Absolute advantages of using the Aptos technologies while performing lifting are as follows:</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><ul><li>Simplicity, easiness, economy of use Minimally invasive nature and low trauma of the procedures</li><li>Reliability and sufficient duration of qualitative lifting</li><li>Possible combination with other interventions and a short rehabilitation period</li></ul><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify">	The Aptos methods constitute a new, nontraditional trend in aesthetic surgery, requiring further study and development. Despite the apparent simplicity, these operations do have their own nuances, which if taken into consideration and complied with provide a good stable outcome.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">	Unskillful hands and insufficient experience could at best yield undesirable results and rapid relapses and at worst complications. Such practitioners would rapidly be disappointed, ascribing failures to imperfection of the method and speaking against it, which is unfortunate. Doing so, they ignore suggestions to undergo a teaching course. These circumstances thwart progress and hamper improvement not only of the Aptos method but also of minimally invasive aesthetic surgery as a whole. To dismiss suture lifting gives no chance to a large number of patients who have appropriate indications and the desire to rejuvenate their appearance to have an alternative to the classic method of lifting and contour plasty of the face.</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p>REFERENCES</p><p>1.
